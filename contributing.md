# Contributing to Catenator

Thank you for your interest in the **Catenator** framework. This project is maintained as a rigorous, architectural standard for AI-assisted product development. We welcome contributions that help refine this "unified grammar."

### Architectural philosophy

Before contributing, please review our core philosophy:

* **Atomic integrity:** Logic should be broken down into its smallest, reusable parts (Micro atoms).
* **Structural over conversational:** We prefer machine-readable YAML structures over descriptive prose.
* **Readiness-focused:** Every contribution should help move a specification closer to a **Readiness score** of 5.

### How to contribute

To maintain the integrity of the framework, we follow a strict "Architect-led" workflow:

1. **Open an issue:** For any significant logic changes or new Meso modules, please open an issue first to discuss the architectural impact.
2. **Fork the repository:** Create a fork and work on a feature branch.
3. **Submit a pull request:** Ensure your PR description clearly explains the technical problem your change solves.
4. **Validation:** All contributions must pass a structural validation check against our existing `schema.yaml`.

### Ownership and governance

As the lead architect, **[Parth Upadhye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-upadhye)** reviews and approves all structural changes to the main branch. This ensures that the framework remains a consistent, hardened backbone for the ecosystem described in **[Spec-driven development with AI](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GNSTYJ6W)**.
