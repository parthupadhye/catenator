# Roadmap

The **Catenator** framework is currently in active development by Engaged Inquiry. Our goal is to move product management from subjective prose to objective, structural data.

## v0.1: The architectural foundation (current)

We are currently finalizing the core grammar of the framework.

* **Core schemas:** Finalize the `schema.yaml` definitions for macro, meso, and micro components.
* **Yaml transition:** Remove all dependencies on obsidian and markdown-specific editors.
* **Standard library:** Populate the repository with reference meso modules for authentication and payments.
* **Readiness metric:** Formally document the 1–5 scoring logic for automated auditing.

## v0.2: The validation engine

The focus shifts from manual documentation to automated structural integrity.

* **Linter release:** A command-line tool to validate Catenator yaml files against the core schema.
* **Automated readiness check:** A script to programmatically calculate the readiness score based on metadata density.
* **Visualizer:** A tool to generate a dependency graph showing how atoms chain into meso modules.

## v1.0: AI-native assembly

Achieving the "zero-shot" generation goal.

* **Context injector:** A tool to bundle catenated specs into a single, token-optimized context block for LLMs (Cursor, Claude, or Copilot).
* **Schema registry:** A hosted directory of community-contributed logic atoms.
* **The architect's console:** A web interface for assembling specs from the component library without manual YAML editing.


## How to use this roadmap as an architect

1. **Transparency:** By labeling the current state as **v0.1 (Incomplete)**, you manage expectations while showing that the "hard thinking" is already done.
2. **Attracting help:** If someone sees "v0.2: Linter release" and they are a developer, they are much more likely to contribute because the task is specific.
3. **Authority:** A roadmap proves this isn't just a single file, but a product with a lifecycle.
