# Contributing to the framework

Engaged Inquiry thanks you for helping refine this unified grammar for AI-assisted development.

## Architectural philosophy

Before contributing, please review our core philosophy:

* **Atomic integrity:** Logic should be broken down into its smallest, reusable parts (Micro atoms).
* **Structural over conversational:** We prefer machine-readable YAML structures over descriptive prose.
* **Immutability:** Do not edit a hardened file; create a new version (e.g., `v0.2.yaml`).
* **Readiness-focused:** Every contribution should help move a specification closer to a **Readiness score** of 5.

## How to contribute

To maintain the integrity of the framework, we follow a strict "Architect-led" workflow:

1. **Open an issue:** For any significant logic changes or new Meso modules, please open an issue first to discuss the architectural impact.
2. **Fork the repository:** Create a fork and work on a feature branch.
3. **Submit a pull request:** Ensure your PR description clearly explains the technical problem your change solves.
4. **Validation:** All contributions must pass a structural validation check against our existing `schema.yaml`.
5. **Ownership:** Lead architect **Parth Upadhye** reviews all structural updates to ensure consistency.

## Ownership and governance

As the lead architect, **[Parth Upadhye(Engaged Inquiry)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parth-upadhye)** reviews and approves all structural changes to the main branch. This ensures that the framework remains a consistent, hardened backbone for the ecosystem described in **[Spec-driven development with AI](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GNSTYJ6W)**.
